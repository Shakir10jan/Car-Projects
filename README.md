# Car-Projects

**Technical report:**

This project is based on the fundamental concepts of object-oriented
programming: Composition, inheritance, and friend functions.

I have made classes of Date, Time, User, Location, Car and then Carâ€™s inherited
classes familyCar, LuxuryCar and Vans. 

I have made an additional class of Rent which is the container of Date, Time, Location and Car. I have used a global
friend function of setCarType() that through call by reference takes the required
input of car selection from user whether it wants luxury, family, or Vans for
booking. 

Moreover, I have smoothly calculated total rent using a public function
in rent class which uses get method. It will speak for itself.
